**Movie Correlation Python**

This project is a Python script that analyzes a dataset of movies and calculates the correlation between various movie 
features such as the year, rating, score, budget, and gross.
The script uses the Pandas library to read and manipulate the data, 
and the Seaborn library to create visualizations of the correlation matrix.
